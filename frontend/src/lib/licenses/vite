Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>&gt;       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>&gt;       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>&gt;       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>&gt;       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>&gt;       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>&gt;       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;    6.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>&gt;       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>&gt;       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>&gt;       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>&gt;       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>&gt;       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>&gt;       PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

While redistributing<br/>&gt;       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>&gt;       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>&gt;       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>&gt;       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>&gt;       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>&gt;       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>&gt;       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>&gt;       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>&gt;       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br/>&gt;       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br/>&gt;       replaced with your own identifying information.
