If You&lt;br/&gt;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&lt;br/&gt;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&lt;br/&gt;      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&lt;br/&gt;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&lt;br/&gt;      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&lt;br/&gt;      as of the date such litigation is filed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&lt;br/&gt;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&lt;br/&gt;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&lt;br/&gt;      meet the following conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&lt;br/&gt;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&lt;br/&gt;          stating that You changed the files; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&lt;br/&gt;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&lt;br/&gt;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&lt;br/&gt;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&lt;br/&gt;          the Derivative Works; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its&lt;br/&gt;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&lt;br/&gt;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&lt;br/&gt;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&lt;br/&gt;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&lt;br/&gt;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&lt;br/&gt;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&lt;br/&gt;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&lt;br/&gt;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&lt;br/&gt;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&lt;br/&gt;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&lt;br/&gt;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&lt;br/&gt;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&lt;br/&gt;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&lt;br/&gt;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&lt;br/&gt;          as modifying the License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&lt;br/&gt;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&lt;br/&gt;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&lt;br/&gt;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&lt;br/&gt;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&lt;br/&gt;      the conditions stated in this License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&lt;br/&gt;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&lt;br/&gt;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&lt;br/&gt;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&lt;br/&gt;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&lt;br/&gt;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&lt;br/&gt;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&lt;br/&gt;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&lt;br/&gt;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&lt;br/&gt;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or&lt;br/&gt;      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&lt;br/&gt;      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,&lt;br/&gt;      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or&lt;br/&gt;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&lt;br/&gt;      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&lt;br/&gt;      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the&lt;br/&gt;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&lt;br/&gt;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&lt;br/&gt;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&lt;br/&gt;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&lt;br/&gt;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&lt;br/&gt;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&lt;br/&gt;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&lt;br/&gt;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&lt;br/&gt;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&lt;br/&gt;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&lt;br/&gt;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&lt;br/&gt;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&lt;br/&gt;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&lt;br/&gt;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&lt;br/&gt;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&lt;br/&gt;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&lt;br/&gt;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&lt;br/&gt;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&lt;br/&gt;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&lt;br/&gt;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&lt;br/&gt;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&lt;br/&gt;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "&amp;lbrace;&amp;rbrace;"&lt;br/&gt;      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a&lt;br/&gt;      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the&lt;br/&gt;      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier&lt;br/&gt;      identification within third-party archives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Copyright &amp;lbrace;yyyy&amp;rbrace; &amp;lbrace;name of copyright owner&amp;rbrace;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");&lt;br/&gt;   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.&lt;br/&gt;   You may obtain a copy of the License at&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software&lt;br/&gt;   distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,&lt;br/&gt;   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.&lt;br/&gt;   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and&lt;br/&gt;   limitations under the License.&lt;br/&gt;
