            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Getting Started:</strong> Upload one or more images using
                the upload area above. Supported formats include PNG, JPEG, WebP,
                AVIF, and GIF.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Choose Tools:</strong> Below the uploader, you'll find buttons
                for different editing tools. Click a tool to add it to your processing
                queue. You can add multiple tools and adjust their parameters.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Reorder Tools:</strong> Drag and drop tools to change their
                order. The order affects how ImageMagick applies them (top to bottom).
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Adjust Settings:</strong> Each tool shows inputs for its
                parameters (e.g., width, height, degree). Modify these to suit your
                needs.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Select Output Format:</strong> Choose an output format like
                PNG or WebP from the dropdown before uploading.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Process:</strong> Click “Upload” to process your images.
                The server will apply your chosen transformations in sequence and
                return the result.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                <strong>Download:</strong> After processing, your file will automatically
                download. If you uploaded multiple images, a .zip archive will be
                returned.
            </p>

                Note: File size is currently limited to 32MB total. If your
                upload fails, try resizing your images or uploading fewer files
                at a time.
