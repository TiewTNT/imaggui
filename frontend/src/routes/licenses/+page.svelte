HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE<br/>==========================<br/><br/>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting<br/>Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands<br/>as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's<br/>principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.<br/><br/>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for<br/>National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)<br/>in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the<br/>software.<br/><br/>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to<br/>BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same<br/>year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became<br/>Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see<br/>https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization<br/>created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.<br/>Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.<br/><br/>All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for<br/>the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python<br/>releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes<br/>the various releases.<br/><br/>    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-<br/>                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute<br/>    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The<br/>    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with<br/>    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.<br/><br/>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,<br/>    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to<br/>    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1<br/>    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.<br/><br/>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's<br/>direction to make these releases possible.<br/><br/><br/>B.

If You&lt;br/&gt;      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&lt;br/&gt;      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&lt;br/&gt;      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&lt;br/&gt;      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&lt;br/&gt;      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&lt;br/&gt;      as of the date such litigation is filed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the&lt;br/&gt;      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without&lt;br/&gt;      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You&lt;br/&gt;      meet the following conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or&lt;br/&gt;          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices&lt;br/&gt;          stating that You changed the files; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works&lt;br/&gt;          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and&lt;br/&gt;          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,&lt;br/&gt;          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of&lt;br/&gt;          the Derivative Works; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its&lt;br/&gt;          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must&lt;br/&gt;          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained&lt;br/&gt;          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not&lt;br/&gt;          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one&lt;br/&gt;          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed&lt;br/&gt;          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or&lt;br/&gt;          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,&lt;br/&gt;          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and&lt;br/&gt;          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents&lt;br/&gt;          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and&lt;br/&gt;          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution&lt;br/&gt;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&lt;br/&gt;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&lt;br/&gt;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&lt;br/&gt;          as modifying the License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&lt;br/&gt;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&lt;br/&gt;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&lt;br/&gt;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&lt;br/&gt;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&lt;br/&gt;      the conditions stated in this License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&lt;br/&gt;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&lt;br/&gt;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&lt;br/&gt;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&lt;br/&gt;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&lt;br/&gt;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&lt;br/&gt;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&lt;br/&gt;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&lt;br/&gt;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&lt;br/&gt;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or&lt;br/&gt;      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&lt;br/&gt;      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,&lt;br/&gt;      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or&lt;br/&gt;      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&lt;br/&gt;      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&lt;br/&gt;      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the&lt;br/&gt;      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any&lt;br/&gt;      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&lt;br/&gt;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&lt;br/&gt;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&lt;br/&gt;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&lt;br/&gt;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&lt;br/&gt;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&lt;br/&gt;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&lt;br/&gt;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&lt;br/&gt;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&lt;br/&gt;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&lt;br/&gt;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&lt;br/&gt;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&lt;br/&gt;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&lt;br/&gt;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&lt;br/&gt;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&lt;br/&gt;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&lt;br/&gt;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&lt;br/&gt;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&lt;br/&gt;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&lt;br/&gt;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&lt;br/&gt;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "&amp;lbrace;&amp;rbrace;"&lt;br/&gt;      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a&lt;br/&gt;      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the&lt;br/&gt;      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier&lt;br/&gt;      identification within third-party archives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Copyright &amp;lbrace;yyyy&amp;rbrace; &amp;lbrace;name of copyright owner&amp;rbrace;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");&lt;br/&gt;   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.&lt;br/&gt;   You may obtain a copy of the License at&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software&lt;br/&gt;   distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS,&lt;br/&gt;   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.&lt;br/&gt;   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and&lt;br/&gt;   limitations under the License.&lt;br/&gt;

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License.

"Patent Claims" of a Contributor<br/>means any patent claim(s), including without limitation, method,<br/>process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by such<br/>Contributor that would be infringed, but for the grant of the<br/>License, by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having<br/>made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its<br/>Contributor Version.<br/><br/>1.12. "Secondary License"<br/>means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, the GNU<br/>Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, the GNU Affero General<br/>Public License, Version 3.0, or any later versions of those<br/>licenses.<br/><br/>1.13.

License Grants and Conditions<br/>--------------------------------<br/><br/>2.1. Grants<br/><br/>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br/>non-exclusive license:<br/><br/>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)<br/>Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,<br/>modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its<br/>Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or<br/>as part of a Larger Work; and<br/><br/>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer<br/>for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its<br/>Contributions or its Contributor Version.<br/><br/>2.2. Effective Date<br/><br/>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution<br/>become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first<br/>distributes such Contribution.<br/><br/>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope<br/><br/>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br/>this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br/>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br/>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br/>Contributor:<br/><br/>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br/>or<br/><br/>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's<br/>modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br/>Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br/>Version); or<br/><br/>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br/>its Contributions.<br/><br/>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br/>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br/>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br/><br/>2.4. Subsequent Licenses<br/><br/>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br/>distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br/>License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br/>permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).<br/><br/>2.5. Representation<br/><br/>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br/>Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br/>to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.<br/><br/>2.6. Fair Use<br/><br/>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br/>applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br/>equivalents.<br/><br/>2.7. Conditions<br/><br/>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br/>in Section 2.1.<br/><br/>3. Responsibilities<br/>-------------------<br/><br/>3.1. Distribution of Source Form<br/><br/>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br/>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br/>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br/>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br/>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br/>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<br/>Form.<br/><br/>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br/><br/>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br/><br/>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br/>Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br/>the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br/>Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br/>than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br/><br/>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br/>License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br/>license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br/>the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br/><br/>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br/><br/>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br/>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br/>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br/>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br/>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br/>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br/>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br/>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br/>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br/>License(s).<br/><br/>3.4. Notices<br/><br/>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br/>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br/>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br/>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br/>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br/><br/>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br/><br/>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br/>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br/>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br/>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br/>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br/>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br/>disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br/>jurisdiction.<br/><br/>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br/>---------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br/>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br/>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br/>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br/>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br/>Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br/>or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br/>recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br/><br/>5. Termination<br/>--------------<br/><br/>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br/>if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br/>compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br/>Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br/>Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br/>ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br/>non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br/>come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br/>Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br/>notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br/>first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br/>from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br/>Your receipt of the notice.<br/><br/>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br/>infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br/>counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br/>directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br/>You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br/>2.1 of this License shall terminate.<br/><br/>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br/>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br/>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br/>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br/><br/><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><br/><em> <em><br/></em> 6.

Litigation<br/>-------------<br/><br/>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br/>courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br/>place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br/>jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br/>Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring<br/>cross-claims or counter-claims.<br/><br/>9. Miscellaneous<br/>----------------<br/><br/>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br/>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br/>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br/>necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br/>that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br/>shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.<br/><br/>10. Versions of the License<br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>10.1. New Versions<br/><br/>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br/>10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br/>publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br/>distinguishing version number.<br/><br/>10.2. Effect of New Versions<br/><br/>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version<br/>of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,<br/>or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license<br/>steward.<br/><br/>10.3. Modified Versions<br/><br/>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br/>create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br/>modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br/>any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br/>such modified license differs from this License).<br/><br/>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary<br/>Licenses<br/><br/>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With<br/>Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the<br/>notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.<br/><br/>Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice<br/>-------------------------------------------<br/><br/>This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public<br/>License, v. 2.0.

"Patent Claims" of a Contributor<br/>means any patent claim(s), including without limitation, method,<br/>process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by such<br/>Contributor that would be infringed, but for the grant of the<br/>License, by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having<br/>made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its<br/>Contributor Version.<br/><br/>1.12.

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br/>distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br/>Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br/>Contributor:<br/><br/>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br/>or<br/><br/>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's<br/>modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br/>Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br/>Version); or<br/><br/>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br/>its Contributions.<br/><br/>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br/>or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br/>the notice requirements in Section 3.4).<br/><br/>2.4.

Distribution of Source Form<br/><br/>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br/>Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br/>the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br/>Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br/>License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br/>attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code<br/>Form.<br/><br/>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form<br/><br/>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:<br/><br/>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br/>Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br/>the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br/>Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br/>than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and<br/><br/>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br/>License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br/>license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br/>the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.<br/><br/>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work<br/><br/>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br/>provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br/>the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br/>Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br/>Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br/>License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br/>under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br/>the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br/>Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br/>License(s).<br/><br/>3.4. Notices<br/><br/>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br/>(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br/>or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br/>the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br/>the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.<br/><br/>3.5. Application of Additional Terms<br/><br/>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br/>Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br/>behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br/>such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br/>You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br/>liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br/>indemnity or liability terms You offer.

Such description must<br/>be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br/>Software under this License.

In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br/>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br/>have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br/>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br/><br/><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><em>*</em></strong><strong><br/><em> <em><br/></em> 6.

The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/><br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br/><br/>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br/>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br/>      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You<br/>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/><br/>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/><br/>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/><br/>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>          stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/><br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br/><br/>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br/>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br/>      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/><br/>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/><br/>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>          stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/><br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/></p>

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br/>      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br/>      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br/>      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br/>      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br/>      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br/>      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br/>      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br/>      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br/>      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br/>      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br/>      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br/>      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br/>      as of the date such litigation is filed.<br/><br/>   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br/>      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br/>      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br/>      meet the following conditions:<br/><br/>      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br/>          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br/><br/>      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>          stating that You changed the files; and<br/><br/>      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br/>          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br/>          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br/>          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br/>          the Derivative Works; and<br/><br/>      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br/>          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br/>          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br/>          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br/>          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br/>          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br/>          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br/>          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br/>          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br/>          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br/>          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br/>          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br/>          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br/>          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br/>          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br/>          as modifying the License.<br/><br/>      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br/>      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br/>      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br/>      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br/>      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br/>      the conditions stated in this License.<br/><br/>   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br/>      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br/>      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br/>      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br/>      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br/>      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br/>      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br/><br/>   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br/>      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br/>      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br/>      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br/><br/>   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br/>      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br/>      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br/>      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br/>      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br/>      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br/>      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br/>      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br/>      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br/><br/>   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br/>      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br/>      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br/>      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br/>      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br/>      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br/>      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br/>      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br/>      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br/>      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br/>      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br/><br/>   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br/>      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br/>      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br/>      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br/>      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br/>      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br/>      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br/>      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br/>      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br/>      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br/><br/>   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br/><br/>      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br/>      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br/>      replaced with your own identifying information.
